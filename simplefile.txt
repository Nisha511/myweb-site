When you do a git pull origin master,
git pull performs a merge, which often creates a merge commit. 
Therefore, by default, pulling from the remote is not a harmless operation: it can create a new commit 
SHA hash value that didnâ€™t exist before. This behavior can confuse a user, because what feels like it should be a
harmless download operation actually changes the commit history in unpredictable ways.
